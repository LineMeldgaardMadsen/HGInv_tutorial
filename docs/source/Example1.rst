Example 1: 1D infiltration
=====

In this example, the hydaulic conductivity in determined in a two-layed model using a electric resistivity sounding.

Problem description
------------

A 1D hydrologcal model is defined by an upper layer of a loamy sand 

**Geophysical data**

To calibrate the hydrological model, a geophysical dataset of electric resitivity data have been measured once a day for 50 days after the begening of the infiltration. 
Each day, 20 quadropole sounding were measured using a Schulemberger electrode configureation. 
The synthetic dataset can be accesed here:
